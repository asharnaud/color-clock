# Color Clock

> This was optional homework from the Iron Yard that helped me:

* Demonstrate understanding of functions, loops/array, variadic behavior, setTimeout() and setInterval()
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS
* Demonstrate Functional Programming methods
* Demonstrate use of DOM APIs (querySelector(), querySelectorAll(), addEventListener())
* Combine approaches of CSS layout, animation, transitions
* Convert numbers between binary and hex (using parseInt() and Number.toString())

***

Putting everything I have learned so far in this clock was definitely a challenge for me but I learned a lot and it was a lot of fun!
